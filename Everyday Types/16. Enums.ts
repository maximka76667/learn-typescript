// Enums
// Enums are a feature added to JavaScript by TypeScript which allows for describing a value
// which could be one of a set of possible named constants. Unlike most TypeScript features,
// this is not a type-level addition to JavaScript but something added to the language and runtime.
// Because of this, itâ€™s a feature which you should know exists, but maybe hold off on using
// unless you are sure. You can read more about enums in the Enum reference page
// (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html).
